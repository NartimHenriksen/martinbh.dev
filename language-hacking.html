      <h2>What is language hacking</h2>
      <p>
      In 2021 I started on a journey to acquire the language of Mandarin Chinese. My motivations at the time were a mix of desire to explore a different culture, and a curiosity about the strange nature of the language, e.g. <i>"How do they type??"</i>.

      I started taking evening classes at my local course center. But I was learning at a slow pace, so I decided that I wanted to self-study so that I could skip ahead to a more advanced class. I read two books which had an outsize effect on me: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CF6T6RE" target="_blank">Hacking Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/006285268X" target="_blank">Ultralearning</a>. These books advocate for a type of self-directed learning popularized by Benny Lewis. It is centered around experimentation and optimization of the learning process itself. Even topics like "procrastination" or "boredom" are viewed as language learning challenges that we can create strategies to overcome. This is what I call "Language Hacking". There is a stark contrast between Traditional Learning and Language Hacking.

        When I started applying these methods, I quickly sped ahead of my class, and soon dropped classes completely, as I was engaged in other forms of learning that were more effective for me. I read the textbooks on my own, did language exchanges in person and online, found texts and sound online, reviewed vocabulary, and took private lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
         Along the way, I also applied flashcards (A memory retention technique heralded by many language learners) to learn the names and locations of every country on Earth, with astonishing ease. This changes my relationship to international news stories, as I understand them better and find them more interesting now. And I now use flashcards to learn the names of new friends and colleagues, which was always a difficult thing for me in the past. This makes me more confident in social situations. The skills that you pick up when language hacking can change your approach to learning in a general sense, and can feel a bit like superpowers.

         I believe that hacking a language and speaking it can be a fantastic source of growth, entertainment and fulfillment, as well as a mode of expresssion. Awesome!

        This kind of problem has bothered me somewhat, I sometimes think of a 92 year old man that I met at my mandarin beginner class. He was struggling with the rigid format and bad learning methods, and it was heartbreaking to see him week by week coming to the conclusion that he would not be speaking mandarin in this life. His age made it more stark but the same outcome happens for anyone that gives up learning because they falsely believe that it's too difficult for them. Which brings me to...

      <h2>
        Language Hacking Workshop
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since I am convinced many people are wasting time with not-great learning approaches, I am considering a "Language Hacking Workshop".
        
        This would probably be in-person, and wouldn't be about teaching language, but rather doing language-hacking together! You could bring any language you want to the workshop.

      <h2>In Case You Weren't Worried about AI</h2>
    <p>So OpenAI just announced that ChatGPT 4 is launching later this week. And some people that I talked to were sorta kinda worried about their careers but weren't really sure what to think. This feels like a bit of a change from the past few years, where most people I've talked to seemed to think worrying is a waste of time and that the doomsayers are too deep in their science fiction books. Yesterday I had a thought that I would like to share with the probably 1 or 2 people who will read whatever the hell this thing is I am writing on.
    </p>
    <h3>The Alignment Problem</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
    There are at least a handful of concerning outcomes that experts are debating and working on. Superintelligent AI might be a superweapon that allows it's inventor to conquer Earth. Sentient AI might be tortured in virtual hellscapes on a scale that makes industrial farming look like Disney World. And if everyone was well-intentioned, AI's might still take our naive instructions so literally that their "perverse instantiation" of our wishes will end in some horribly ironic Monty Python-esque dystopia. For example it might correctly deduce that the safest way for no person to ever get cancer again is to kill all the humans.
    <p>
      This latter category of issue is called the "Alignment Problem". Any coder will attest that it is hard to correctly tell a machine what to do, and you genuinely don't know what happens when you first switch it on. This means that a superhuman general intelligence of any kind is dangerous no matter what goal you try to give it. Many people don't think think the Alignment problem is worth worrying about, so I wanted to give a real example of it that happens today.
      </p>
      
      <h3>YouTube</h3>
      <p>
        YouTube's video recommendation system is crazy advanced, and humans are very predictable. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, it can forego rewards in the short term, if there is a chance of a getting much bigger reward later on. Hundreds of millions of people use Youtube every day, and youtube is more than sophisticated enough to "know" that some offering some videos will have a big expected reward, not because it is the most likely to be clicked on, but because it is a "rabbit hole", that often leads to people watching 10 more videos before coming to their senses.
        </p>
        <p>
       YouTube also knows when to serve up this type of video. It'll "sense" from my online behavior that I am super depressed and looking for an escape from reality, and then just, at that moment, remind me to indulge my addiction to watching Starcraft matches, debates, Feynmann lectures or Tetris World Championships. It'll sneakily, based on my interests at the time, try the most likely rabbit hole gateways that will make me spend more time on the platform than I want to. </p>
       <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_UPHsGR6fM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <h3>Echo Chambers</h3>
    <p>
       I would argue that the rabbit holes are already damaging, since for some of us it is making it harder to spent our time, and therefore our life, in the way that we most want to. But the really sinister part is when some rabbit holes go very deep. They might work by making us doubt something we've always believed to be true, creating curiosity and suspension. For those that are less inclined to think critically, this can lead directly into echo chambers which any succesful video recommender system should LOVE. The whole thing with echo chambers is that people who are in them will want to get all of their information from them, since more and more regular sources will appear to be flawed or untrustworthy. People who are successfully reprogrammed will happily watch upwards of 10 hours of youtube every day. For youtubes AI, this is like winning the lottery. Except much more achieveable.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion &lt;-- As if I were the first to think of this</h3>
      <p>
      I am not in a position to determine whether the youtube algorithm is brainwashing people, but I believe that it COULD happen, which for me illustrates that we don't need some form of advanced AGI to take the alignment problem seriously.
      
        I think it is arguable whether many AI systems today are already unsafe for humans, which may be more tangible than the kind of futuristic doomsday-ey talk that many people are unconvinced by. If you thought the Alignment Problem or AI concerns in general were too hypothetical then I hope this example was interesting for you. Please contact me and challenge this idea if you think it's stupid. Okay see ya!

      <h2> Rant about Traditional Language Learning </h2>
      
      <div class="dialogue">
      <p>"Since their social needs would be a natural driver of interaction with locals, it's important that they form a community of english speakers to hang out with". </p>
      <p>"The elegant solution to this is to simply, group them all together into dorms where we can be sure that, being mandarin students, no one speaks mandarin!"</p>
      <p>"Great, make sure it's the cheapest and most convenient housing option when they are planning their trips, and don't know what to do about housing. This also helps prevent them from learning culture!"</p>
      <p>"Okay I've finished installing the flourescent light tubes in the tiny white rooms. All learning must take place in here right?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, make sure to give them lot's of homework and tests on many characters that they will have to cram for and then immidiately forget afterwards".</p>
      <p>"Obviously".</p>
      <p>"mmm, well done evil school men".</p>
      <p>"mmm yeeesh thank you mister evil school man!".</p>
      <p> <b>*CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP*</b> </p>

      <p>As I am writing this, I am following a mandarin language class at a university in Taipei, and while I do get something from it (mostly the access to a native speaking teacher), I am also pretty disappointed with the approaches taken here. In general it is similar to the evening lessons I took as a beginner. They don't account for the student's interests or learning style, they don't apply the most effective learning methods and they don't encourage any form of experimentation around the learning process.
      </p>
      <p>I currently benefit at least as much from living in a hostel with taiwanese people, as I do getting from going to classes and doing homework. I believe this one thing alone is actually more effective for me than the schooling is. And even though it's that important, the university has not even mentioned that it is a good idea. Every single one of my fellow students are living in international dorms, and they all speak english to each other outside of the classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is just one example of how institutions manage to constantly create systems that defy everything we know about effective language learning. While Language Hackers optimize for language learning, traditional language schools seem to optimize for language non-learning.
      </p>
      <p>Okay, got that out of my system...</p>

      <p>I don't know if "Blog" is the right term for what this page is meant to be. </p>
      <p>Since I am using this website as a type of business card, I thought I could use this subpage to be a window into my thoughts and personality for people who are interested in working with me. Though I don't know if I will actually find time to sit down write on it. I have many varied interests, so we will see what pops up in here if anything....</p>

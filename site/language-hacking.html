      <h2>Language Hacking</h2>
      
      <p>
      I got into learning mandarin sometime in 2021, and have been having a ton of fun with it. One of the interesting things is there is so many ways you can go about learning it, and some can feel like a life hack once you discover them. I got inspiration from two books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CF6T6RE" target="_blank">Hacking Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/006285268X" target="_blank">Ultralearning</a>.     </p>
      
      <h2>
        Creating new Language Hacking Resources
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would like to create some resources for Extensive Reading and Listening. As opposed to intensive reading, <i>extensive</i> reading means reading at your current level, fast and without straining yourself. I believe this is one of the best ways build familiarity and fluency in your target language, but there is not enough material out there which is adjusted to the right difficulty levels. The idea is to create a set of graded readers, for example at a 300-word vocabulary, in Danish or some other language. Inspiration can be drawn from the Mandarin Companion series of graded readers, though my aspirations are not quite so high. Could also add an anki deck to bootstrap the 300 words, and maybe record the stories as a podcast as well.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm also interested in making some tools to integrate dictionaries with SRS (Anki). This made a big difference for me. The dictionary pleco has great builtin integration with anki, but it can also be achieved with a plugin, either for Anki or for the dictionary. A great example of an Anki plugin that does this for mandarin is <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1128979221">Chinese Support Redux</a>. The main goal would be to cut down the amount of time making and managing flashcards which is a hassle.
